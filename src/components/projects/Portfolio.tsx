				Features:
					- Converted to TypeScript (one of my specialties)
					- Serverless contact form utilizes ReCapchta and AWS Lambda (originally in JS but converted to Java for practice)
					- This portfolio is a great way to track my progress as a developer (link to old portfolio and GitHub repo)
					- No matter how serious my skills get though, I will always keep the humor and whimsy that made me fall in love with the web in the first place...
						- Easter eggs
