		"description": "The BandBook application is a tool for ear musicians. It is designed to help users learn songs by ear, transcribe, practice, study, and share and collaborate with others. On the technical side, this application has an (arguably) overzealous commitment to modern web standards. The stack is comprised of exclusively modern vanilla HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript (ES6+). All JavaScript is written in an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) style and type safety is enforced through JSDoc comments. The application is local first and uses IndexedDB for data storage."
