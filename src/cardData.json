Since I initially built this site as the final project of my Code Louisville Front End Web Development course, it's packed with fun JS scripts. Feel free to view <a href='https://github.com/csobrien90/obrien-trombone' target='_blank'>the GitHub repo for this site</a> and check out the README for a full list of design features."

We are a collective of jazz musicians in Louisville, KY committed to culturally authentic playing and teaching of jazz music. I built this website before knowing about mobile-first design, accessibilty standards, and CSS flexbox and am now in the process of updating it to reflect best practices."

The notebook paper styling has been fun to experiment with but needs a little more tweaking to be made more responsive. Feel free to check it out, play to your hearts content (it's pretty addicting!) and offer any suggestions. If you're interested in the code, you can <a href='https://github.com/csobrien90/mastermind' target='_blank'>check out the GitHub repo here.</a>"

		"description": "This is the website for Fiber Coven, a weekly witchy themed podcast about the knitting, spinning, and everything fiber related. Since most of my projects are self directed, I enjoyed this opportunity to work with an established brand. It has also been a fun challenge integrating third party widgets (a PodBean player, MailChimp newsletter sign up, etc.) into the design. If you want to explore how I did that, <a href='https://github.com/csobrien90/fiber-coven' target='_blank'>check out the GitHub repo here.</a>"

I've only just started but am really enjoying these bite-sized tasks and learning a lot!
