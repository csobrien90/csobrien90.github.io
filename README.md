## To Do

- Refactor experience section

### General

- Color themes (Original, Light, Dark)
- Adjust styles to generally look slicker and more professional
    - background box to be more radiant
    - shadows and other indications of depth
    - More interactivity and better feel to interactive elements
    - animations (transitions), and scrolls should have more natural movement
- Make sure it is lightning fast - no glitching on scroll
