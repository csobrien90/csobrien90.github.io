# Chad O'Brien's Web Dev Portfolio

*My Web Dev portfolio - hosted at [chado.dev](https://chado.dev)*


## To Do

- Refactor project slider
    - Limit number of projects with more details/pizzazz for each
    - Remove slider altogether and integrate projects/skills
	- Significantly reduce Work Experience and just provide resume to download
- Color themes (Original, Light, Dark)
- Adjust styles to generally look slicker and more professional
    - background box to be more radiant
    - shadows and other indications of depth
    - More interactivity and better feel to interactive elements
    - animations (transitions), and scrolls should have more natural movement
- Make sure it is lightning fast - no glitching on scroll
